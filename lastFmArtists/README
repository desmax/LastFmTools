This script interacts with last fm api to fetch list of artists that user has played
There are 4 possible params:
1. --user - Used to specify last fm user name. Required param.
2. --plays-limit - Used to specify count of artist plays after which script will end parsing. Default is 1.
3. --artists-limit - Used to specify maximum artists count that can be processed. Default is 9999.
4. --file - Accepts path to a file. Used to save fetched artists list. If no file specified than all will be outputted to stdout.

Usage example:
php lastFmArtists.php --user=desmax --artists-limit=20 --file=artists --plays-limit=10

Or with short params:
php lastFmArtists.php -u=desmax -a=20 -f=artists -p=10

Also you can create config file with the same params. By default script will try to find config file with name config.ini
in the same directory that it has been placed, but you can override this path by specifying cli param --config

Here is example of config file:
user = desmax
file = /home/maxim/artists
#artists-limit = 9999
artists-limit = 4000
plays-limit = 25
